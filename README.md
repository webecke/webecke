# Dallin Webecke

Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at Brigham Young University. I'm currently working as a TA and software developer for BYU's CS 240 class, where I help students learn to construct big software projects and I help develop the autograder program to grade their work.

I currently have a few personal projects in the works, that you will be able to see on my pinned repo list. I'll update this readme eventually with more details.

If you want to get in contact with me, feel free to email me: me@webecke.dev
