### _Software Engineer_

Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building reliable and user-friendly software solutions. I have a strong
background in TypeScript and Java, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. 

I just graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I am currently working
for a handful of local businesses in a freelance capacity, as well as working on my own personal projects and
business ventures.

Originally starting as a personal project to better learn React and have something to show off to employers, 
_LakeStats_ has grown into a potential business after receiving great feedback from the boating community in Utah and
parties interested in forming business partnerships with _LakeStats_.

_LakeStats_ exists to provide boaters with an easy and convenient way to get current information about the major lakes
in the American Southwest. It currently provides current and historical water levels, and information on boat ramp 
access. There are many features planned, including weather, elevation specific maps, and more.

Since I am trying to turn this into a business, I have made the repository private, but I will be finding a way to
document the project's development in from both technical and user experience perspectives. But the site is live, and
will be updated regularly with new features and improvements.

_The Autograder_ is a system developed by me and other CS 240 TAs to grade the work of students taking BYU's Advanced 
Software Construction Course. It greatly reduces help-wait time by reducing in-person pass-offs, and eliminating manual 
grading. It is currently in use to grade the work of 400+ students every semester.

As I have now graduated and no longer work as a CS 240 TA, I am no longer actively developing this project, but it
continues to be used by the course and maintained by the current TAs. This is the project that really got me started in
software development, and I am very proud of the work I did on it.

### Key Contributions

- Streamlined student user experience by simplifying their interface and refactoring ineffective systems.
- Developed configuration system to allow administrators to change previously hard-coded values.
- Created tools to allow administrators to view student and submission details.

_Nebula_ is a project I worked on as part of my senior capstone course at BYU. It is a progressive web app that allows
students easily find good student housing, and allows them to sell their contracts in a convenient way.

One major piece of my time on this project was being the project "SCRUM Master", in charge of keeping the team on track
and managing the issues and task items we needed to complete.

The project is still in development, and because of NDA restrictions, I cannot share the code of my contributions 
publicly. Hopefully someday _Nebula_ will go live and will help out students all over the country.

### Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented several user interfaces, particularly the housing-listing creation and editing features
- Improved database schema to support new features and improve performance
- Enhanced already existing map features to load faster and provide more listing info
