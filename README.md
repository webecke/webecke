# Dallin Webecke
### _Software Engineer_

Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an emerging software engineer focused on developing detailed and reliable software to simplify and solve everyday 
problems. Currently finishing up my CS degree at BYU where I work as a TA helping students master coding concepts, and 
develop a product to evaluate their work. Thus far, I specialize in TypeScript and Java, though I'm always looking to 
learn new languages and technologies.

_The Autograder_ is a system developed by me and other CS 240 TAs to grade the work of students taking BYU's Advanced 
Software Construction Course. It greatly reduces help-wait time by reducing in-person pass-offs, and eliminating manual 
grading. It is currently in use to grade the work of 400+ students every semester.

### Key Contributions

- Streamlined student user experience by simplifying their interface and refactoring ineffective systems.
- Developed configuration system to allow administrators to change previously hard-coded values.
- Created tools to allow administrators to view student and submission details.

_JolleyBites_ is my attempt to solve a problem my mom has with her baking business: how much do different recipes 
actually cost to make? Originally I built a Google Sheet to solve the problem, but I recently decided to build an
application to solve her problem in a more modern and user-friendly way.

_LakeStats_ is my alternative to other websites that exist that provide data to the public about lakes in the southwest. 
The goal is to provide a service that loads faster, is simpler, and easier to use than existing services. Also, it's an 
excuse to learn new technologies like Java Spring and React. Originally I was building it for Lake Powell only, but
soon discovered how easy it would be to expand to other lakes. Thus, LakeStats!

**Live Version:** None yet - still really early development
